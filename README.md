# ESG-Insight-A-Multi-Level-NLP-System-for-Corporate-Sustainability

> **Automating ESG report analysis with NLP and Transformers**

---

## Overview

**ESGInsight** is an end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** system that transforms unstructured corporate ESG reports into structured, interpretable insights.  
It integrates classical linguistic processing with modern deep learning models such as **FinBERT** (for sentiment analysis) and **BART** (for abstractive summarization) to evaluate Environmental, Social, and Governance performance objectively.

This project bridges the gap between qualitative ESG disclosures and quantitative intelligence ‚Äî empowering stakeholders to assess sustainability performance efficiently, transparently, and at scale.

## System Architecture

The ESGInsight pipeline consists of **12 modular layers**:

1. **PDF Upload** ‚Äì Upload ESG reports in PDF format.  
2. **Text Extraction** ‚Äì Extract textual content using `PyMuPDF` and `pdfplumber`.  
3. **Text Preprocessing** ‚Äì Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and normalization.  
4. **Linguistic Analysis** ‚Äì POS tagging, dependency parsing, and chunking via `spaCy`.  
5. **Semantic Analysis** ‚Äì Word embeddings using Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT.  
6. **Sentiment & Topic Modeling** ‚Äì ESG-specific sentiment detection (FinBERT) and topic discovery (LDA).  
7. **Pragmatic Analysis** ‚Äì Coreference and discourse resolution for contextual coherence.  
8. **Generative Summarization** ‚Äì Abstractive summaries via BART/T5.  
9. **ESG Scoring** ‚Äì Weighted sentiment aggregation into a 0‚Äì100 ESG Score.  
10. **Embedding & Similarity** ‚Äì Cosine similarity analysis across companies.  
11. **Visualization Layer** ‚Äì WordClouds, bar charts, radar plots, and gauge indicators.  
12. **Dashboard & Output Layer** ‚Äì JSON output and interactive dashboards for interpretation.

```

## Visualizations

- ESG pillar sentiment distribution
- Word cloud of most frequent ESG terms
- Radar chart of ESG pillar comparison
- Gauge chart for overall ESG score

## Future Scope

- Add multilingual ESG report analysis
- Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved contextual reasoning
- Implement Explainable AI (XAI) for transparent ESG scoring
- Enable real-time ESG trend monitoring via APIs
- Deploy an interactive web dashboard for company comparisons

## Conclusion 

ESGInsight showcases how AI and NLP can automate sustainability analytics. By integrating linguistic, semantic, and transformer-based methods, it translates verbose ESG disclosures into concise, data-driven intelligence ‚Äî making ESG assessment faster, consistent, and transparent.
